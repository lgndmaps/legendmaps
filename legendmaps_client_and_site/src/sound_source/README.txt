Legend Maps uses audiosprites.

Currently set up with this package:
https://medium.com/game-development-stuff/how-to-create-audiosprites-to-use-with-howler-js-beed5d006ac1

Once you have everything configured as described there you can create new sfx audiosheet with:
audiosprite --path 'G:/Work/crypt/legendmaps_site/src/sound_source/' -e mp3 --output sfx *.wav
